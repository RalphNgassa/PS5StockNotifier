# PS5StockNotifier

This short script written in Python makes use of the TwitterAPI to fetch tweets from the account @Lbabinz
which frequently provides updates on the object scarcier than gold, which is... the SONY PS5. With a help of developer account
that I created, the tweets that contain a few keywords that contain some given words will be sent to me via an email notification.
